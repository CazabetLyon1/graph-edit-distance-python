graph-edit-distance-python
==========================

Disclaimer: This project is a draft implementation graph edit distance calculation. The intent of the algorithm is to apply graph edit distance to the task of comparing sentences (nautral language processing).

The algorithm was written as part of my master's thesis, and takes dependency graphs created with MaltParser as input.

Roadmap:

- generalizing the code making it applicable to all types of graphs
- networkx support
